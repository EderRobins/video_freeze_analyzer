This application is an answer for Texel assignment by Eder Robins 

To execute the program just run main() function. 
The main function expects a url list.

for testing the examples in the assignment just run:
python3 main.py

Design explanation:
The program is divided to 3 main classes. 
1. valid periods list generator - includes interface class and a derived class for using ffmpeg.
2. single video freeze analyzer - does the valid periods duration and max period calculations in a single passing
3. videos freeze analyzer - calculate sync.
Note: url download is part of main because i assumed that its likely that there will also be times user would use it on local disc

Next steps:
1. ffmpeg list generator optimization - attempt to reduce temporary files by figure out a way to redirect output or connect directly to lib.
2. for multiple videos run single video analyzer in parallel by running each video in a different thread.
3. change video analyzer class to a decorator design pattern. it will allow adding easily new features (for example min valid period)
3. use scatter-gather method to calculate sync.
4. the code is a POC. moving to production code requires at least error handling and unit test for each module.
5. add comments in code, i didn't had time for that.

requirements:
1.linux OS.
2. ffmpeg.
3. python 3


Conclusions:
The task was challenging and very interesting.
